# HCC Campaign Tool

Helping people complain to their councillors with extreme efficiency. Created as part of the campaign to make [Pembury Circus](https://hackneycycling.org.uk/pembury) safe for cycling, because the council decided not to hold a formal public consultation, as they normally would for such large public projects.
